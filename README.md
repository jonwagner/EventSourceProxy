# EventSourceProxy #

**EventSourceProxy** (ESP) is the easiest way to add scalable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logging to your .NET program.

**Now in NuGet!**

There are now two versions of ESP:

* EventSourceProxy - works with the .NET Framework - System.Diagnostics.Tracing
* EventSourceProxy.NuGet - works with the EventSource library in NuGet - Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing

## Why You Want This ##

- You really should be logging more than you do now.
- ETW is the best way to log in Windows.
- It's about zero effort to add logging to new code.
- It's zero effort to add logging to existing interfaces.
- Generated IL keeps overhead low, and it's almost nothing if tracing is off.

Here is ESP implementing a logging interface for you automatically:

	public interface ILog
	{
		void SomethingIsStarting(string message);
		void SomethingIsFinishing(string message);
	}

	// yeah, this is it
	var log = EventSourceImplementer.GetEventSourceAs<ILog>();

	log.SomethingIsStarting("hello");
	log.SomethingIsFinishing("goodbye");

Here is ESP doing the hard work of implementing an EventSource if you really want to do that:

	public abstract MyEventSource : EventSource
	{
		public abstract void SomethingIsStarting(string message);
		public abstract void SomethingIsFinishing(string message);
	}

	// ESP does the rest
	var log = EventSourceImplementer.GetEventSourceAs<MyEventSource>();

Here is ESP wrapping an existing interface for tracing:

	public interface ICalculator
	{
		void Clear();
		int Add(int x, int y);
		int Multiple(int x, int y);
	}

	public class Calculator : ICalculator
	{
		// blah blah
	}

	Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

	// again, that's it
	ICalculator proxy = TracingProxy.CreateWithActivityScope<ICalculator>(calculator);

	// all calls are automatically logged when the ETW source is enabled
	int total = proxy.Add(1, 2);

And let's say that your interface doesn't look at all like what you want logged. You can add rules to clean all that up:

Say you have the following interface:

	interface IEmailer
	{
		void Send(Email email, DateTime when);
		void Receive(Email email);
		void Cancel(string from, string to, DateTime earliest, DateTime latest);
	}

	class Email
	{
		public string From;
		public string To;
		public string Subject;
		public string Body;
		public IEnumerable<byte[]> Attachments; 
	}

Set up rules on how ESP should trace the data to ETW:

	TraceParameterProvider.Default
		.For<IEmailer>()
			.With<Email>()
				.Trace(e => e.From).As("Sender") 
				.Trace(e => e.To).As("Recipient")
				.Trace(e => e.Subject).As("s")
 					.And(e => e.Body).As("b")
					.TogetherAs("message")
				.Trace(e => String.Join("/", e.Attachments.Select(Convert.ToBase64String).ToArray()))
					.As("attachments")
		.For<IEmailer>(m => m.Send(Any<Email>.Value, Any<DateTime>.Value)
			.Ignore("when");
		.ForAnything()
			.AddContext("user", () => SomeMethodThatChecksIdentity());

And now the Send method will log:

	* Sender : From
	* Recipient : To
	* Message : { "s":subject, "b":body }
	* Attachments : [ base64, base64 ]
	* User : current user

So, this is great for adding logging to any interface in your application.

# Features #

* Automatically implement logging for any interface, class derived from EventSource.
* Takes all of the boilerplate code out of implementing an EventSource.
* Supports EventSource and Event attributes for controlling the generated events.
* Supports reusing Keyword, Opcode, and Task enums in multiple log sources.
* Automatically proxy any interface and create a logging source.
* Add rules to transform parameters and objects from your interface to your log.
* Proxies also implement _Completed and _Faulted events.
* Automatically convert complex types to JSON strings for logging.
* Optionally override the object serializer.
* Optionally provide a logging context across an entire logging interface.
* Easily manage Activity IDs with EventActivityScope.

# New in v2.0 - Logging Transforms #

* Use attributes and configuration rules to transform your interface calls to entirely different logging calls. See [Controlling Logged Data](https://github.com/jonwagner/EventSourceProxy/wiki/Controlling-Logged-Data) and [Adding Additional Logging Context](https://github.com/jonwagner/EventSourceProxy/wiki/Adding-Additional-Logging-Context).

* Want to get the data out of ETW? Use the [Microsoft Enterprise Library Semantic Logging Application Block](http://nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseLibrary.SemanticLogging/). It has ETW listeners to log to the console, rolling flat file, and databases, so you can integrate ETW with your existing log destinations.
